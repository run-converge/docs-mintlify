<Note> The Outbrain Ad Platform integration allows you to see platform-specific metrics (e.g. Ad Spend) in Converge. 
To send data from Converge to Out, check out the [Outbrain Ads Connection](/connections/integrations/taboola) instead.</Note>

## Set up the Ad Platform Sync

1. Navigate to the [Ad Platforms Tab](https://app.runconverge.com/-/ad-platforms) in your Converge dashboard.

3. Select **Outbrain** from the drop-down list and sign in with your Outbrain Account.

4. Once the Outbrain account has been linked, you can **select your Outbrain Ads Account**. 

5. After pressing **create** your Outbrain Ads metrics will stream into Converge.
