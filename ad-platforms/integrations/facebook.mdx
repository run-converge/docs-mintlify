<Note> The Meta Ads Ad Platform integration allows you to see platform-specific metrics (e.g. Ad Spend) in Converge. 
To send data from Converge to Meta, check out the [Meta Ads Connection](/connections/integrations/facebook) instead.</Note>

 Changing the URL parameters will put the ad back into a processing state which may last up to an hour. **In rare cases, the social proof of the ad could be reset** and the ad be sent back into the learning phase.
</Warning>

If you want your UTMs to be compatible with **both** the Converge and [Google Analytics 4](/connections/integrations/ga4) attribution report, use the following template instead

```
utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign={{campaign.name}}&utm_content={{ad.name}}&cvg_source={{site_source_name}}&cvg_adid={{ad.id}}&cvg_cid={{campaign.id}}`
