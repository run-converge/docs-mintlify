<Note> 
 **We recommend centralizing the tracking template into the account-level settings and removing all tracking templates from your specific ads, ad groups and campaigns.** 
  
  Importantly, if you also configured these parameters on the ad, ad group, or campaign level, these will be preferred. 
 
 If you still wish to use your existing ad, ad group or campaign-level tracking templates, then you need to follow the following instructions: 
  
  <Accordion title="Set up campaign-level UTM Tracking Parameters"> Go to `Settings` > `Campaign settings` > `Select a campaign` > `Edit` > `Change tracking template`. </Accordion>
   <Accordion title="Set up ad or ad group level UTM Tracking Parameters">  Go to `Ad groups/Ads` and `assets` > `Select an ad group/ad `> `Edit` > `Change tracking template`. </Accordion>
