Insights consist of one or multiple metrics. 
Metrics are based on Events, Ad Platforms or a combination of both.

## Aggreggations

When you select Event Metrics such as **Added To Cart**, you might be looking for:
- The total number of **Added To Cart**-events
- The total sessions with an **Added To Cart**-event
- The **Added To Cart**-conversion rate
- The Cost per **Added To Cart**
- etc. 

Similarly if you select Ad Platform Metrics such as **Clicks**, you might be looking for:
- The total number of **Clicks**
- The **CTR**
- The **CPM** 
- etc.

These different ways of counting the underlying event or ad platform metric are called **Aggreggations**.
Every time you pick a metric, you will need to choose an aggregation as well.

## Renaming a Metric

1. Click on the <Icon name="pencil"/>-icon next to the metric you want to rename.

    </Frame>
2. Give your metric a new name and click on <Icon name="check"/>
    <Frame>
        ![](/images/insights-dashboards/rename-confirm-new-name.png)
    </Frame>
3. Notice that in your insight, the metric is approppriately renamed

## Hiding a Metric

You might want to recombine some metrics in Formula Mode and only show a subset of the metrics that you have used in the query. 

For example, say that we want to show the **New Customer %**, which is defined as `100% * New Customers / Total Orders`. 
The query would look something like this. 

<Frame>
![new customer formula](/images/insights-dashboards/custom-formula-new-customer-percentage.png)
</Frame>

To make sure that the Insight only consists of Metric **C**, I can hide metric A & B as follows: 

1. Click on the <Icon name="eye"/>-icon next to the metric you want to hide. In our example this would be metric A and B.
    <Frame>
        ![](/images/insights-dashboards/rename-icon.png)
    </Frame>

2. The metrics should have disappeared from the insight.
