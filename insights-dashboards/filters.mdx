Filters allow you to filter out certain values based on certain properties.

Filters allow you to answer questions such as:
- How many Added To Cart-events do I have *in Canada*
- How many Website visits come *from mobile users*
- How much Spend comes from *my Summer Facebook campaign*
- How much Purchases can be *UTM-attributed to TikTok*

## Applying a Filter

How you apply a filter to an insight depends on whether you want the filter to filter on a **Metric**-level (applies to a single metric) or on an **Insight**-level (applies to all metrics in the insight).

### Metric Filters

1. Click on the <Icon name="filter"/>-icon, next to the metric you want to filter on.

        ![filter-icon](/images/insights-dashboards/filter-icon.png)
    </Frame>
2. Click on <IconText name="plus" text="Add filter"/>
3. Choose a property to filter on and a condition, e.g. **`total_price` greater than 50**
    <Frame>
        ![filter-icon](/images/insights-dashboards/active-metric-filter.png)
    </Frame>
4. Done, your metric values should be filtered based on this condition.

### Insight Filters

1. Click on Click on <IconText name="plus" text="Add filter group"/> in the Click on <IconText name="bars-filter" text="Add filter"/>-section of the query builder.

    </Frame>
2. Click on <IconText name="plus" text="Add filter"/> 
3. Choose a property to filter on and a condition, e.g. **`total_price` greater than 50**
    <Frame>
        ![filter-icon](/images/insights-dashboards/insight-filter-example.png)
    </Frame>
4. Done, all of your metric values should be filtered based on this condition.
    <Info>
    As an example of a filter that applies across a few metircs, notice the insight below that shows all:
    - `Placed Order`-events with a `total_price` greater than 50
    - All sessions with a `Placed Order`-event for which this event has a `total_price` greater than 50
