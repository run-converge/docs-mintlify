#### Multi-store setups

A typical example of source filters is when you are setting up multiple stores.
You might want to set up different GA4 Connections for each store for example. 
You can use Source Filters to filter out the approppriate Sources per Connection.

As an example, if you have a US and CA store and you are creating a GA4 Connection for the US Store -- you will want to configure your US Sources to be the only ones streaming into this Connection.
