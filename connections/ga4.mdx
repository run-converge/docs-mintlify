## Configuration Options

The following options can be configured in the Connection Configuration.

### Connection Type

How Converge forwards events to Google Analytics 4. 
Options include:
- **Client-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event client-side.
- **Server-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event (except for `$page_load`) server-side through the Measurement Protocol. 
- **Server-side GTM (Recommended)**: loads the `gtag` in a server-side GTM container, sends server-side conversions through the Measurement Protocol.
