## Overview

You can configure how the Converge connections should behave based on the visitor's consent preferences.

<Note>
Check out the [Consent implementation](/sources/consent) to learn how to send consent preferences to Converge.

## Converge connections
There are two ways to customize how Converge connections handle consent: the **consent category** and the **consent mode**.

### Consent category

You can classify Converge connections into two consent categories: `analytics` and `marketing`. Consent is tracked separately for each category.

The consent category can be set under the **Consent** subtab of the connection **Configuration**

### Consent mode

Connections can send events to the integrations through both the browser and server.
You can configure the connection to treat both ways of tracking differently according to the following modes:

- **Off** (default): No user consent is required for this connection. All events are sent to the connection.
- **Browser only**: Consent is only applied to events tracked directly in the browser. Server-side events are always sent to this connection.
- **On**: User consent is required for all events. Events are not sent to this connection if the user has denied consent. If consent was not tracked, events are still sent.
- **Strict**: User consent is required for all events. Events are only sent to this connection if the user has given explicit consent. If consent was not tracked, events are not sent.
