## Set up custom events for your Connections

Converge allows you to leverage custom events in all of your Connections.

<Accordion icon="location-dot" title="How to set up custom events for your Connection">
1. Navigate to the [Connections Tab](https://app.runconverge.com/-/connections) in your Converge dashboard
2. Click on the Connection for which you want to send a custom event.
3. Click on the **Configuration** tab and on the **Advanced**-subtab and scroll down to **Custom Events**.
4. Click on **Edit configuration** to add a custom event mapping.
5. Pick the Custom Event you want to forward and then fill in the name you want to forward it as. 
    <Info> E.g. in the screenshot below, we are forwarding a `Lead`-event, every time a `Subscribed To List`-event triggers in Converge </Info>
    <Frame>
    ![set up custom event](/images/connections/custom-events/custom-events-0.png)
    </Frame>
6. Press **Save** once you are happy with the configuration.
7. Use the [Connection Log](/connections/monitoring#connection-logs) to monitor that your event is being forwarded correctly.

## Limitations

Some destinations do not accept server-side events, so you should always verify this in the specific Connection Integration documentation.

If you want to forward a particular custom event to these destinations, you should set up your custom event client-side instead.
