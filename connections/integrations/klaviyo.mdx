## Using Converge to increase abandoned cart revenue on Klaviyo

You may already be using Klaviyo's abandoned cart flows based on the `Added To Cart`-events and `Started Checkout`-events tracked by the Klaviyo pixel on the browser. 

However, Klaviyo's browser identification is based on a third-party cookie meaning that most customers will not be successfully identified after 7 days (see our section on <OutboundLink linkText="Cookie Behavior" linkTarget="/sources/concepts/aliases#default-cookie-behavior"/> ).

```mermaid
flowchart LR

  id4("\`*User* visits website with Klaviyo cookie and **Subscribes to Newsletter**\`") -. 8 days later (Klaviyo cookie is lost).-> id5("\`*User* visits website without cookie and **Adds to cart**\`") ~~~ id6(["\`**Abandoned Cart Email** ✖\`"])
  style id6 color:#d40027,stroke:none

```

When Converge is set up with a first-party cookie, it can reliably re-identify customers past that 7-day mark (see: [Setting up a server-side first-party cookie](/sources/concepts/aliases#setting-up-a-server-side-first-party-cookie)).
Customers using our pre-built [Shopify](/sources/website-integrations/shopify) or [Magento](/sources/website-integrations/magento) integrations already have a first-party cookie as part of their Converge setup.

```mermaid
flowchart LR

  id4("\`*User* visits website with first-party cookie and **Subscribes to Newsletter**\`") -. 8 days later (Converge cookie stays).-> id5("\`*User* visits website with cookie and **Adds to cart**\`") ~~~ id6(["\`**Abandoned Cart Email** ✓\`"])
  style id6 color:#d40027,stroke:none

```

For most customers, we expect an abandoned cart revenue uplift of 20-50%.

## Adding product URL and image URL to Converge events to power Klaviyo flows

A common use case of the Klaviyo Destination is to build Klaviyo Email Flows based on Converge Events. 
As such, you might want to include a Product URL or Product Image URL in the Converge Event so you can leverage these in your email flows. 

To that end, you will want to extend the Converge Event Spec for the following events.
Once you add the custom properties to your events, Converge will automatically forward these to the Klaviyo Destination.


### Extending your Converge Event implementation for Klaviyo

Find code examples below that illustrate where **you should add the Product URL and Product Image URL custom event properties**.

<AccordionGroup>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="I already have the Klaviyo integration for Shopify, should I also set up a Converge connection?">
  If you are using any of Klaviyo's prebuilt integrations, then there is still value in setting up the Converge Klaviyo Connection to track the `Viewed Product`, `Viewed Category`, and `Added To Cart` events or to send [Custom Events](/sources/extending-the-spec/custom-events) to Klaviyo.

## Event Mapping

Converge automatically maps the following events from the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec) to the Klaviyo spec.

| Converge Event Name                                           | Klaviyo Event Name |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [$page_load](/sources/converge-spec#page-load)                | `__activity__`     |
| [Viewed Product](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-product)       | `Viewed Product`   |
| [Viewed Collection](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-collection) | `Viewed Category`  |
| [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)         | `Added to Cart`    |
| [Started Checkout](/sources/converge-spec#started-checkout)   | `Started Checkout` |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order)           | `Placed Order`     |


This integration also auto-tracks some additional events that are not part of the Meta Base Spec but are so heavily requested that we automatically forward them.

| Converge Event Name | Klaviyo Event Name |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| Ordered Product     | `Ordered Product`  |
