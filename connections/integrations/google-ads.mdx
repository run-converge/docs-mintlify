## Installation Instructions

<Note> 

This is a client-side connection, meaning that you will need to be tracking all events client-side (including `Placed Order` and `Started Subscription`) for this connection to work properly.

If you want to set up a Google Ads conversion for a server-side tracked event, then you should follow the instructions to [Import server-side conversions in Google Ads through GA4](#import-server-side-conversions-in-google-ads-through-ga4)
 </Note>

## Import server-side conversions in Google Ads through GA4

Our Google Ads Connection does not support forwarding server-side conversions natively. 

However, you can still get a Converge server-side event in Google Ads through the **GA4 import** functionality. 


<Steps>

<Step title="Make sure your conversion arrives in GA4">
   If your conversion event already exists in GA4 (e.g. when you want to import a `purchase` or `add_to_cart` -conversion), then you can move straight onto step two.

   If you are looking to set up a custom event as a conversion in Google (e.g. a `new_customer_purchase` -event), you should first make sure that your event is configured as a <OutboundLink linkText="Custom Event" linkTarget="/connections/custom-events"/> in the GA4 Connection.

</Step>

<Step title="Import your GA4 event in Google Ads as a conversion">
      <Info> The steps below demonstrate importing the `new_customer_purchase` event. But you should import the event/conversion that applies to your use case. </Info>
   
      1. Navigate to your GA4 dashboard and click on the settings icon in the bottom left corner.
         <Frame> ![ga-2](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-1.png) </Frame>

      2. In the submenu, navigate to **Events**.
         <Frame> ![ga-3](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-2.png) </Frame>

      3. Under the Events submenu, mark `new_customer_purchase` as a conversion, if you'd like to import any other conversions, then mark these too.
         <Frame> ![ga-4](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-3.png) </Frame>

      4. The custom conversion is now created in GA4, time to import it into Google Ads. Navigate to Google Ads Manager, go to the **Tools and Settings > Conversions** submenu in the top bar and click on **New conversion action**.
         <Frame> ![ga-5](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-4.png) </Frame>

      5. Choose the **Import** as your means of setting up the conversion and choose **Google Analytics 4 properties > Web** as your source of import. After that, hit **Continue**.
         <Frame> ![ga-4](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-5.png) </Frame>

      6. Choose the `new_customer_purchase` event (and optionally other events) and click on **Import and continue**.
         <Frame> ![ga-5](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-6.png) </Frame>

      7. Choose your newly created conversion from the conversions list to change its properties.
         <Frame> ![ga-6](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-7.png) </Frame>

      8. Click on **Edit Settings**.
         <Frame> ![ga-7](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-8.png) </Frame>

      9. Mark the conversion as _Secondary_ and hit **Save** if you want to use it exclusively for reporting purposes.
         <Frame> ![ga-8](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-10.png) </Frame>

      10. Change the conversion goal to _Purchase_ and hit **Save** and **Done**.
         <Frame> ![ga-9](/images/connections/google-ads/google-nc-purchase-9.png) </Frame>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why are one or more of my campaigns not receiving conversion data since Converge?">
   If none of your campaigns are receiving any conversions, you likely did not configure your conversions correctly and should revise the [Installation instructions](#installation-instructions).
   
   If only some of your campaigns are not receiving conversions, then check the following: 
   1. Make sure that the campaigns are still active and have significant ad spend 
   2. Verify that you have set the **Goals** of all campaigns to **"Using Account settings"** in their respective campaign settings.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I have an existing Google Ads Tag running side-by-side Converge?">
   In general, you should be OK running a separate Google Ads Tag and the Converge Google Ads Connection side-by-side. 

   However, in rare cases, your existing Google Ads tag and the Converge Google Ads Connection can interfere with each other, especially when the *Deploy a separate data layer for Converge*-option is enabled.

   If you notice under-reporting of your conversions set up through the Converge Google Ads Connection and you have an existing Google Ads Tag installed on the website, turn this functionality off under **Advanced > Edit Configuration**.

## Event Mapping

Converge automatically maps the following events from the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec) to the Google Ads spec.

| [Viewed Collection](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-collection)   | `view_item_list`      |
| [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)           | `add_to_cart`         |
