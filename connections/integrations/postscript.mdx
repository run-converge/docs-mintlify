## Adding product URL and image URL to Converge events to power Postscript flows

A common use case of the Postscript Destination is to build Postscript SMS Flows based on Converge Events. 
As such, you might want to include a Product URL or Product Image URL in the Converge Event so you can leverage these in your flows. 

To that end, you will want to extend the Converge Event Spec for the following events.
Once you add the custom properties to your events, Converge will automatically forward these to the Postscript Destination.

<Accordion title='Extending your Converge Event implementation for Postscript'>

Find code examples below that illustrate where **you should add the Product URL and Product Image URL custom event properties**.
