## Installation Instructions

1. In Converge, navigate to the Sources tab and click on **Create a new source**

4. Navigate to the Shopify dashboard, click on **Settings**
5. Click on **Apps and and sales channels** in the Settings modal
6. Click on **Develop apps**, you might have to choose **allow custom app development** in a pop-up
7. Click on **Create an app**, give the app the name `Converge` and choose your own email address as the developer
8. Choose **Configure Admin API scopes** and mark the following 4 scopes (i) `read_products`, (ii) `read_customer_events`, (iii) `read_customers`, (iv) `read_orders`.
9. Click on **Save** and then **Install app**. Reveal and copy the Admin API access token, paste the token in the Converge webapp under **Shopify API Password**. Do not fill in a starting date, just click on **Create source**

> ℹ️ You should see the Shopify store syncing data, no need to wait before its fully synced to create connections -- we will automatically check which orders are historic and new and forward only the new ones in case a connection is active while historically syncing
