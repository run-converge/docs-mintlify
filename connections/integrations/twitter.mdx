## Installation Instructions

<AccordionGroup >

<Accordion icon="list" title="Installation Instructions">

1. Navigate to your Twitter Ads account and choose **Tools > Events Manager**.

2. Copy your Twitter Pixel ID
   1. If you already have an events source, at the top of the page, find the 'Twitter pixel' section and copy the ID. (e.g. `obarl`)
   2. If not, you will be prompted to create a new event source, follow the instructions and copy the ID when you are done.

3. In the Converge dashboard, under Connections, click <IconText name="circle-plus" text="Create New Connection" iconLocation="before" iconType="regular"/ > and fill in your Pixel ID.
4. See below for instructions on how to configure your conversion events.

</Accordion>


<Accordion icon="circle-dollar-to-slot" title="Create your conversion events">

<Note> This is a client-side-only connection, meaning that you will need to be tracking all events client-side (including `Placed Order`) for this connection to work properly. </Note>


1. In the Twitter Ads > Tools > Events Manager, click on the **Create Event** button. 
2. Give your event a name, e.g. 'Placed Order' when you are setting up a purchase conversion.
3. Pick a Twitter event type, e.g. 'Purchase'. You can find a suggested mapping of Converge to Twitter Ads event types [below](#event-mapping).
4. Configure your attribution settings and click on **Next**.
5. Choose the 'Define event with code' setup method and click on **Next**.
6. Click 'Save' to finish the setup.
7. You can now find the event in the Events table in the Twitter Ads Events manager.
   Under the event, the ID is composed as `tw-{pixelID}-{eventID}`.
   Copy the `eventID` into the 'Twitter Event IDs' section of the Converge connection configuration.

<Note> Repeat the steps above for all the events you want to report on in Twitter Ads </Note>
</Accordion>
<Warning> Once you have installed your Converge Connection, you should **pause or remove all existing Twitter Ads tracking**. Leaving these on will lead to duplicate tracking.  </Warning>

## Event Mapping

Events are not automatically mapped, you need to configure the mapping of the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec) to your Twitter events manually.
We recommend the following mapping to the Event Type:

| Converge Event Name                                             | Twitter Event Type    |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [$page_load](/sources/converge-spec#page-load)                  | `Page view`           |
| [Viewed Product](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-product)         | `Content view`        |
| [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)           | `Add to cart`         |
| [Started Checkout](/sources/converge-spec#started-checkout)     | `Checkout initiated`  |
| [Added Payment Info](/sources/converge-spec#added-payment-info) | `Added payment info`  |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order)             | `Purchase`            |
