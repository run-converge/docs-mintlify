## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I see a Duplicate Pixel ID warning in my console?">
  If you are a Shopify store, Converge needs to load both a `theme.liquid` pixel and a Shopify Custom Pixel to track reliably. 
  See the [FAQ in the Shopify Integration](/sources/website-integrations/shopify#faq) for more detailed information.

  Converge makes sure that no duplicate events get sent, even though the Facebook Pixel needs to be loaded in two separate places for complete event coverage. 

  <Note> If you are not using the Shopify Web integration, you might have an old pixel installed using a different tracking method and you should turn this one off.</Note>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why do I see "increase coverage" or "update recommended"-warnings in my Events Manager?'>

<Frame>
![update-recommended](/images/connections/facebook/facebook-update-recommended.png)
![increase-coverage](/images/connections/facebook/facebook-increase-coverage.png)
</Frame>

Meta is warning you here that not all of your events are receiving identifiable information (e.g. `email`).
Ideally, Facebook would have an email for every Added To Cart that ever happens on your website so they can easily attribute it.

​However, many people on the website are anonymous (they have never given their email to your store and thus Converge cannot track it). If the user never gives their email or address, then we can never send that email back.
**​Converge sends as many of these parameters as there are available**.

The only events where you would expect very high email match rate are events where the user always has to give an email (e.g. `purchase`). 
**For all events where certain parameters are not always available** (e.g. you do not expect all `AddToCart` or an `InitiateCheckout` to have an `email`), **you can safely ignore this warning**.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="How do I use the NewCustomerPurchase event?">
  Converge automatically sends the `NewCustomerPurchase` event to Facebook. To start using it for reporting and optimization, you need to create a custom conversion in Facebook Events Manager.

  1. In the Events Manager, go to [Custom conversions](https://www.facebook.com/events_manager2/custom_conversions) and click on **Create Custom Conversion**.
  2. Give your custom conversion a name, e.g. `New Customer Purchase`.
  3. Select the pixel Converge is streaming to as the data source. The action source should be 'Website'
  4. Select the `NewCustomerPurchase` custom event under the 'Event' section.
  5. Click on the 'Select your own category' link and choose the 'Purchase' category.
  6. You cannot leave the 'Rules' section empty, but you should not filter out any events. Simply add a filter which is always true, e.g. `URL doesn't contain "doesnotexist"`.
  7. Click on 'Create' to save your custom conversion.

  You can now optimize for this custom conversion when creating ads, or report on it by adding a column in your ads manager.

## Event Mapping

Converge automatically maps the following events from the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec) to the Meta spec.

| Converge Event Name                                                                               | Meta Event Name                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [$page_load](/sources/converge-spec#page-load)                                                    | `PageView`                              |
| [Viewed Product](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-product)                                           | `ViewContent`                           |
| [Viewed Collection](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-collection)                                     | `ViewContent`                           |
| [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)                                             | `AddToCart`                             |
| [Started Checkout](/sources/converge-spec#started-checkout)                                       | `InitiateCheckout`                      |
| [Added Payment Info](/sources/converge-spec#added-payment-info)                                   | `AddPaymentInfo`                        |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order)                                               | `Purchase`                              |
| [Started Subscription](/sources/converge-spec#started-subscription)                               | `Subscribe`                             |
| [Placed Recurring Subscription Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-recurring-subscription-order) | `RecurringSubscriptionPaymentSucceeded` |
| [Cancelled Subscription](/sources/converge-spec#cancelled-subscription)                           | `CancelSubscription`                    |

This integration also auto-tracks some additional events that are not part of the Meta Base Spec but are so heavily requested that we automatically forward them.

| Converge Event Name                                                       | Meta Event Name       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order)  (New Customers Only) | `NewCustomerPurchase` |
|                                                                           |                       |
