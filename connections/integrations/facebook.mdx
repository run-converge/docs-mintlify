2. From your Events Manager, **click on the Facebook Pixel** you would like to connect.

3. In the Facebook Pixel menu, choose the **Settings** subtab.

4. From this subtab, you can find your **Pixel ID**, copy it -- you will need it in a later step.

5. Scroll down in the Settings subtab until you find **Generate access token**, click on it. Copy this token as well.

6. In your Converge dashboard, under Connections, click <IconText name="circle-plus" text="Create New Connection" iconLocation="before" iconType="regular"/ >.

7. Give your connection an appropriate name (e.g. `Facebook Connection | {YOUR_PIXEL_ID}`) and **choose the Facebook App**.

8. Paste in the Pixel ID you acquired in the earlier step in the **Pixel ID** field. Paste in the access token you acquired earlier in the **Access Token** field.

9. Fill in your homepage domain name in the **Your Domain name** field, it does not need to include `https://`.

10. Click on **Create Connection**

<Warning> Once you have installed your Converge Connection, you should **pause or remove all existing Facebook tracking**. Leaving these on will lead to duplicate tracking.  </Warning>

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I see a Duplicate Pixel ID warning in my console?">
  If you are a Shopify store, Converge needs to load both a `theme.liquid` pixel and a Shopify Custom Pixel to track reliably. 
  See the [FAQ in the Shopify Integration](/sources/website-integrations/shopify#faq) for more detailed information.

  Converge makes sure that no duplicate events get sent, even though the Facebook Pixel needs to be loaded in two separate places for complete event coverage. 

  <Note> If you are not using the Shopify Web integration, you might have an old pixel installed using a different tracking method and you should turn this one off.</Note>

## Event Mapping

Converge automatically maps the following events from the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec) to the Meta spec.

| Converge Event Name                                                                               | Meta Event Name                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |

| [Viewed Collection](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-collection)                                     | `ViewContent`                           |
| [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)                                             | `AddToCart`                             |

| [Started Subscription](/sources/converge-spec#started-subscription)                               | `Subscribe`                             |
| [Placed Recurring Subscription Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-recurring-subscription-order) | `RecurringSubscriptionPaymentSucceeded` |
| [Cancelled Subscription](/sources/converge-spec#cancelled-subscription)                           | `CancelSubscription`                    |

This integration also auto-tracks some additional events that are not part of the Meta Base Spec but are so heavily requested that we automatically forward them.
