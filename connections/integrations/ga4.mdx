## Installation Instructions

<AccordionGroup >  
<Accordion icon="list" title="Installation Instructions">

1. Navigate to your GA4 Property and choose <IconText name="gear" text="Admin"/> > **Data collection and modification** > **Data streams**.

2. If you do not have a data stream yet, you should click **Add stream** > **Web**. If you do have a data stream already, you should click on the datastream.
   &nbsp;

3. Copy the **Measurement ID** from the top right corner. You will need it later.
   &nbsp;

4. Click on **Measurement Protocol API secrets** on the same page.

   <Info> If you do not see the Measurement Protocol API secrets option, this means that you do not have `Edit` permissions for this GA4 Property.  </Info>
   

5. Click on **Create** to generate a new secret, and give it the name Converge. After creating, copy the **Secret value**.
   &nbsp;


6. In your Converge dashboard, under Connections, click <IconText name="circle-plus" text="Create New Connection" iconLocation="before" iconType="regular"/ >  and fill in your **Measurement ID** and **API Secret**. After that click **Create Connection**.
   &nbsp;


</Accordion> 
<Warning> Once you have installed your Converge Connection, you should **pause or remove all existing Google Analytics 4 tracking**. Leaving these on will lead to duplicate tracking.  </Warning>

## Configuration Options

The following options can be configured in the Connection Configuration.

#### Connection Type

How Converge forwards events to Google Analytics 4. 
Options include:
- **Client-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event client-side.
- **Server-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event (except for `$page_load`) server-side through the Measurement Protocol. 
- **Server-side GTM (Recommended)**: loads the `gtag` in a server-side GTM container, and sends server-side conversions through the Measurement Protocol. 

#### Custom Events

The GA4 connection supports setting up custom events, see [here](/connections/custom-events#set-up-custom-events-for-your-connections) for a deep-dive.

When the (recommended) sGTM mode is selected, there are two additional configuration options for each custom event:
- **Client** or **Server**.
   Configure where the custom event is sent from.
   By default, custom events are triggered from the browser.
   In some cases, you may want to trigger the event from the server instead.
   This is useful for events that are exclusively sent server-side to Converge.
- **Event** or **Conversion**.
   Choose whether the custom event should be marked as a conversion in GA4.


#### Custom Event Properties

Converge allows you to map properties that were tracked on a source from Converge into a custom property in Google Analytics 4.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I see a lot of events with a Skipped status in the Connection Log?">
  Google Analytics 4 does not natively deduplicate events that are being sent from **both** the server and the browser. 
  
  As such, the Converge connection will automatically not forward the **server** copy of the event and only send the browser copy of the event.
  
  These server-side copies will show up with a `Skipped` status in the Connection Log. However, the event will still arrive in GA4 through the browser-side copy.
