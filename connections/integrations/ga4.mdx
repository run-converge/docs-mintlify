## Installation Instructions

<AccordionGroup >  
<Accordion icon="list" title="Installation Instructions">

1. Navigate to your GA4 Property and choose <IconText name="gear" text="Admin"/> > **Data collection and modification** > **Data streams**.

2. If you do not have a data stream yet, you should click **Add stream** > **Web**. If you do have a data stream already, you should click on the datastream.
   &nbsp;

3. Copy the **Measurement ID** from the top right corner. You will need it later.
   &nbsp;

4. Click on **Measurement Protocol API secrets** on the same page.

   <Info> If you do not see the Measurement Protocol API secrets option, this means that you do not have `Edit` permissions for this GA4 Property.  </Info>
   

5. Click on **Create** to generate a new secret, and give it the name Converge. After creating, copy the **Secret value**.
   &nbsp;


6. In your Converge dashboard, under Connections, click <IconText name="circle-plus" text="Create New Connection" iconLocation="before" iconType="regular"/ >  and fill in your **Measurement ID** and **API Secret**. After that click **Create Connection**.
   &nbsp;


</Accordion> 
<Warning> Once you have installed your Converge Connection, you should **pause or remove all existing Google Analytics 4 tracking**. Leaving these on will lead to duplicate tracking. Check the [Turn off your old tracking setup](/guides/turn-off-tracking#ga4) guide for additional instructions. </Warning>

## Configuration Options

The following options can be configured in the Connection Configuration.

#### Connection Type

How Converge forwards events to Google Analytics 4. 
Options include:
- **Client-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event client-side.
- **Server-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event (except for `$page_load`) server-side through the Measurement Protocol. 
- **Server-side GTM (Recommended)**: loads the `gtag` in a server-side GTM container, and sends server-side conversions through the Measurement Protocol. 

#### Custom Events

The GA4 connection supports setting up custom events, see [here](/connections/custom-events#set-up-custom-events-for-your-connections) for a deep-dive.

When the (recommended) sGTM mode is selected, there are two additional configuration options for each custom event:
- **Client** or **Server**.
   Configure where the custom event is sent from.
   By default, custom events are triggered from the browser.
   In some cases, you may want to trigger the event from the server instead.
   This is useful for events that are exclusively sent server-side to Converge.
- **Event** or **Conversion**.
   Choose whether the custom event should be marked as a conversion in GA4.


#### Custom Event Properties

Converge allows you to map properties that were tracked on a source from Converge into a custom property in Google Analytics 4.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Forward a custom event property to GA4">

<Note>

We **do not allow nested event properties** to be forwarded as a custom property. 

<Accordion title="Expand for more information">
  I.e. if the event properties look like this:

   ```json
   {
   property_1: "value", 
   items: {
         property_2: "value_2"
      }
   }
```

then we do support forwarding `property_1` as a custom property, but we do not support forwarding `property_2`.
</Accordion>

</Note>

<Steps>
 <Step title="Set up the forwarding rule in Converge">
    1. Navigate to the <OutboundLink linkText="Connections Tab in Converge" linkTarget="https://app.runconverge.com/-/connections" />, and click on the GA4 Connection.
    2. Navigate to the **Configuration** > **Advanced** sub-tab, and click on **Edit Configuration**.
    3. Click on  <IconText name="plus" text="Add Event Property" /> 
    4. Choose the mapping from the Converge property to the desired GA4 property.

 <Step title="Set up a custom definition in GA4">
   5. Navigate to your Google Analytics Property and click on <IconText name="gear" text="Admin" /> > <br/> <IconText name="shapes" text="Custom definitions" iconType="regular"/>
   6. Click on **Create custom dimension**.
   7. Fill in your desired **Dimension name** (this is how your dimension/property will show up in GA4), and choose **Event** as your Scope. Optionally add a description and choose the mapped property that you set up in step 4 to fill in **Event parameter**.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I see a lot of events with a Skipped status in the Connection Log?">
  Google Analytics 4 does not natively deduplicate events that are being sent from **both** the server and the browser. 
  
  As such, the Converge connection will automatically not forward the **server** copy of the event and only send the browser copy of the event.
  
  These server-side copies will show up with a `Skipped` status in the Connection Log. However, the event will still arrive in GA4 through the browser-side copy.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I see a discrepancy between purchases in GA4 and Placed Orders in Converge?">
   If you see that there is a discrepancy, check off the following:
   
   1. Make sure that your GA4 property and your Converge dashboard are in the same timezone. There might be a difference due to a timezone misalignment.
   2. Verify that you have no active <OutboundLink linkText="Filters" linkTarget="/connections/filters"/> that are filtering out certain purchases. You can check this in the <OutboundLink linkText="Connection Logs" linkTarget="/connections/monitoring#connection-logs"/>.
   3. Make sure that you configured the [connection type](#connection-type) for this connection to be sGTM or server-side. If you are only tracking client-side, then your purchases might not get tracked due to Ad blockers and tag-loading issues.
   4. Verify that you have **disabled** "Collect automatically detected user-provided data"under  <IconText name="gear" text="Admin" /> > <IconText name="database" text="Data collection" iconType="regular"/>.
   5. If your cookiebanner informs Converge that the user has given no consent, then Converge will pass this `denied`-consent parameter to GA4 and GA4 will drop this purchase. You can verify whether this is the case by inspecting the GA4 Connection Logs for the `Placed Order` events. If you find a `denied` consent parameter under the profile properties then it means that your cookiebanner passed a `denied`status for these purchases.

      </Frame>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How to configure cross-domain tracking in GA4?">
   If your customer journey goes through multiple domains (e.g. landing pages or checkout on a different domain), it is important to configure this in GA4 to avoid broken customer journey reports.

   You can configure cross-domain tracking through the following steps: 
   1. Go to <IconText name="gear" text="Admin" /> > **Data collection and modification** > **Data streams**.
   2. Select your data stream > **Configure tag settings** > **Configure your domains**.
   3. You have now arrived at the Cross-domain Linking Configuration. In some cases, GA4 will already provide you with some suggestions. If not, then you can add your domains by adding a condition. When setting up a condition, make sure that you use the **Contains** match type.
   4. Save your changes. 
   
</Accordion>

<Accordion title='Why do I see redundant "Viewed Product" and "Added Product"-events arriving in my GA4 property?'>
  This is most likely a legacy Universal Analytics property / pixel that is streaming events into your new GA4 property. 

  1. Navigate into your old Universal Analytics Property (usually you can do this by clicking on your GA4 property and then chooseing the property whose property ID starts with `UA-`)
      <Frame>
         ![ua-1](/images/connections/ga4/ua-events.png)
      </Frame>

  2. Click on **Admin** > **GA4 Setup Assistant**.
      <Frame>
         ![ua-2](/images/connections/ga4/ua-events-1.png)
      </Frame>

  3. Make sure that your Google Analytics 4 property is **not connected**.
