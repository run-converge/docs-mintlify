<Accordion icon="list" title="Installation Instructions">

1. Navigate to your GA4 Property and choose **Admin > Data collection and modification > Data streams**.

2. If you do not have a data stream yet, you should click **Add stream** > **Web**. If you do have a data stream already, you should click on the datastream.
   &nbsp;

3. Copy the **Measurement ID** from the top right corner. You will need it later.
   &nbsp;

4. Click on **Measurement Protocol API secrets** on the same page.

   <Info> If you do not see the Measurement Protocol API secrets option, this this means that you do not have `Edit` permissions for this GA4 Property.  </Info>
   

5. Click on **Create** to generate a new secret, and give it the name Converge. After creating, copy the **Secret value**.
   &nbsp;


6. In your Converge dashboard, under Connections, click **Create New Connection** and fill in your **Measurement ID** and **API Secret**. After that click **Create Connection**.
   &nbsp;

<Warning> Once you have installed your Converge Connection, you should **pause or remove all existing Google Analytics 4 tracking**. Leaving these on will lead to duplicate tracking.  </Warning>

## Configuration Options

The following options can be configured in the Connection Configuration.

### Connection Type

How Converge forwards events to Google Analytics 4. 
Options include:
- **Client-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event client-side.
- **Server-side**: loads the `gtag` and sends every Converge event (except for `$page_load`) server-side through the Measurement Protocol. 
- **Server-side GTM (Recommended)**: loads the `gtag` in a server-side GTM container, sends server-side conversions through the Measurement Protocol.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I see a lot of events with a Skipped status in the Connection Log?">
  Google Analytics 4 does not natively deduplicate events that are being sent from **both** the server and the browser. 
  
  As such, the Converge connection will automatically not forward the **server** copy of the event and only send the browser copy of the event.
  
  These server-side copies will show up with a `Skipped` status in the Connection Log. However, the event will still arrive in GA4 through the browser-side copy.
