## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title='How do I exclude tax and shipping costs from the order values?'>
        In the connection configuration, under the  advanced tab, you can configure whether you want to send **gross** or **net** order values. **Net** order values do not include tax and shipping.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Why are my events not being forwarded?'>
        Verify that you've configured the events you want to forward as **Conversion events** in the connection configuration.
        
        If your events are showing up as **skipped** in the connection logs, double check that your event properties conform the [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order) event spec.
        If converge cannot parse the event into an AWIN order, the event cannot be forwarded and shows as **skipped**.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="How do I send custom paramters to AWIN?">
        Under the **Advanced** tab in the AWIN connection, you can add custom parameters to your events. Only string or numeric parameters are supported. These are sent as a list of values.
        
        For example, when specifying <code>order_type</code> and <code>language</code> custom parameters, the following lists could be sent to AWIN
        ```
        [Placed Order, sample, en]
        [Placed Order, gold, de]
        ```
        <Note>The Converge event name is automatically included as a custom parameter.</Note>
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title='Do you support differentiating between new and existing customers?'>
        Yes, this is enabled by default.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion title='How do I track the channel parameter'>
    By default, this is set to <code>aw</code>, as recommended by AWIN. You can customize this by setting an <code>$awin_channel</code> profile property on your events. 

    ```javascript
    cvg({
        method: 'track',
        eventName: 'Registered Custom Channel',
        profileProperties: {
            $awin_channel: 'custom_channel'
        }
    })
    ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Event Mapping

There is no default mapping. You need to configure which events are forwarded as AWIN orders yourself.
