## Overview

Converge provides the following tools to monitor and debug whether your Connections are correctly set up.
- [Connection Logs](#connection-logs)

---

## Connection Logs

Converge stores detailed logs of every event that gets sent to Converge including [event properties](/sources/converge-spec), [profile properties](/sources/source-concepts#profile-properties) and [aliases](/sources/source-concepts#aliases).

### Where to find Connection logs

1. Navigate to the [Connections Tab](https://app.runconverge.com/-/connection) in your Converge dashboard
2. Click on the Connection you want to debug
3. Click on the **Logs** tab to see the logs
4. Click on any of the Log Lines to inspect a Log instance

### Filter through the logs

- **By Event Name**: You can select a subset of events to show in the log by clicking on **Select events** and then ticking the relevant events.
- **By Date**: You can use the date picker in the right top corner to select log lines from a particular date range.
- **By Forwarding Status**: You can click on **Select status** to see the [Forwarding Status](#forwarding-status) of a particular event.
- **By Connection Type**: Whether the forwarding is processed through the **Server** or through the **Browser** (client-side).


### Forwarding Status

Every event that gets processed by the Connection gets a forwarding status. 
This status gives you insight as to _how_ the Connection processed this data. 

| Status       | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Success`    | The event was correctly received by the destination                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Failure`    | The event failed to be delivered, read the log detail for more information                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `Retry`      | The event is being retried (until `Success` or `Failure`)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `Filtered`   | The event was processed by the Connection and filtered out (i.e. it has **not** been sent to the destination) based on one of the [Connection Filters](/connections/filters)                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `External`   | An event was fired to this destination that was **not triggered by Converge**  <Note> If you see a bunch of events with an `External` status, this means that another tracking source is still active and should likely be turned off </Note>                                                                                                    |
| `Skipped`    | An event was processed by the Connection and skipped by the Connection to adhere to the Destination Specification <Info> This status usually occurs when Converge processes both browser-side and server-side events but the Destination does not accept server-side events or cannot effectively deduplicate events from two sources.   </Info> |
| `No consent` | The server-side event was not forwarded because the visitor has not given consent for the connection consent category.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
