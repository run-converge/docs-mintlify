## Using the Channels attribution page

You can access the Channels attribution page by clicking on <IconText text="Attribution" name="piggy-bank" iconType="duotone"/> and navigating to the **Channels** sub-tab. Or by navigating directly to the <OutboundLink linkText="Channels" linkTarget="https://app.runconverge.com/-/attribution/channels"/> attribution page.

### Changing the attribution model

<Note> Changing the attribution model will only change the attribution model of **UTM-based metrics**. The in-platform conversions and metrics are determined by the attribution model by the ad platform itself</Note>

We allow you to change the attribution model that Converge should use to attribute its **UTM metrics** (e.g. **UTM Purchases**).

### LTV

The Channels attribution table allows you to visualize the **LTV** for each source, campaign, adset or ad. These values correspond to the *Average Revenue Per Paying User* (**ARPPU**) for each cohort.

The value is calculated by identifying the profiles linked to purchase events ([Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order)) attributed to each source, campaign, adset or ad (i.e. the same profiles linked in **UTM Purchases**).
The cumulative revenue (considering **Placed Order** events) for each of these profiles is calculated within the following time frames: 30, 60, 90 days and lifetime.
The revenue for all the profiles is averaged out for each cohort.

The values are available as four separate columns: **LTV**, **LTV (30d)**, **LTV (60d)** and **LTV (90d)** that may be included in the table as needed.

<Note>These columns are hidden by default. See [Customizing the table](#customizing-the-table) for details on how to add them to the table.</Note>
