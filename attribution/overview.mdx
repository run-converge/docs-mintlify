## FAQ

<Accordion title="Why are my Shopify Sales and Converge Revenues misaligned?" >

The Converge Revenues card and the Shopify Sales card show slightly different metrics. 

Specifically, Converge includes Gift Card revenue in your total revenue number, and it will not subtract refunds. 
Shopify, however, will show a sales number of which refunds are already subtracted and without gift card revenue. 

**In short**: 

- **Shopify Sales** = `Gross Revenue` - `Refunds` - `Gift Card Revenue`
- **Converge Revenue** = `Gross Revenue`

</Accordion>
