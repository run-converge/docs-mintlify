## Overview

Converge allows you to extend each part of the Converge Spec. 
You can track custom events, event properties, profile properties, and aliases easily using [Converge JS](/sources/website-integrations/converge-pixel) or the [Webhook](/sources/server-integrations/webhook) integration.


### Tracking custom event properties for auto-tracked events

If you are using one of our prebuilt source integrations and you want to include custom properties (or modify existing properties) on these events; then you can do so using the `set`-method.

Imagine for example that I want to send a custom property with my `Added To Cart`-event. 
I would then call the following function  _before_ the `Added To Cart`-event is fired.

```js
cvg({method: "set", eventProperties: {hello:"world"}})
```

When my `Added To Cart`-event fires, it will now include the custom `hello -> world` property mapping.

You can modify profile properties in the same way, a full example of the function would be:

```js
cvg({method: "set", properties: {...profileProperties}, eventProperties: {...eventProperties}})
```
