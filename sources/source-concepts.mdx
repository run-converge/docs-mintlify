## An introductory example

Imagine an ecommerce store that has the following minimal customer journey:

1. **PageView**: User visits the storefront
2. **Added To Cart**: User adds an item to cart
3. **Placed Order**: User places an order

For the optimal setup, they will want to track `PageView` and `Added To Cart` on the browser, but `Placed Order` events on <Tooltip tip="Important to track 100% of conversions"> the server</Tooltip>.

### Challenges with server-side tracking 
There are three main challenges this store will need to deal with, all of which are important concepts in Converge.
- [Profile properties](#profile-properties): to include browser-side information into the server-side order-event.
- [Deduplication](#deduplication): to make sure that the same order does not get processed twice.
- [Aliases](#aliases): to recognize which browser-side events and which server-side events come from the same user.

## Profile properties

It is possible to include **profile properties** in an event. These properties are characteristic of the user. These properties are **persisted across events**, whereas the event properties are only available and relevant to the event itself.

Profile Properties allow you to store information on a user that you might need later. 
For example, the Converge Pixel will [auto-track](./converge-spec#page-load) a bunch of browser session information so this is available for your server-side events (e.g. the `Placed Order` event in the [example](#an-introductory-example) above).

However, profile properties are also useful for storing information across events *within* a single source. 
Imagine a user that triggers a `Subscribed to Newsletter` event with an `$email` parameter. Afterwards that same user triggers an `Added To Cart`.
Storing the `$email` as a profile property ensures that you have this information available at the moment of the `Added To Cart`-event without you as a developer having to pass this information again.

```javascript Converge Pixel - Javascript
cvg({
  method: "track",
  eventName: "Subscribed To Newsletter",
  properties: {
    formId: "your-form-id",
  },
  profileProperties: {
    $email: "john.smith@apple.com",
    $first_name: "John",
    $last_name: "Smith",
    $phone_number: "+199999999",
  },
});
```

```python Converge Webhook - Python
resp = requests.post(
    "{YOUR_POSTBACK_ENDPOINT}",
    json=
        {
        "event_name": "Subscribed To Newsletter",
        "properties": {
          "formId": "your-form-id",
        },
        "profile_properties": {
            "$email": "john.smith@apple.com",
            "$first_name": "John",
            "$last_name": "Smith",
            "$phone_number": "+199999999",

        }
    }
)

## Deduplication

It is possible to include **profile properties** in an event. These properties are characteristic of the user. These properties are **persisted across events**, whereas the event properties are only available and relevant to the event itself.
Converge supports deduplication natively. You can deduplicate events with an optional `eventID` parameter. This is especially important for events that are used as conversions.
Converge will deduplicate events with the same `eventID` at ingestation time.

 <CodeGroup>

```javascript Converge Pixel - Javascript
cvg({
  method: "forward",
  eventName: "Placed Order",
  properties: {}, // your event properties
  eventID: "X01",
});
```

```python Converge Webhook - Python
resp = requests.post(
    "{YOUR_POSTBACK_ENDPOINT}",
    json=
        {
        "event_name": "Placed Order",
        "properties": {},
        "profile_properties": {},
        "event_id" : "XO1", # Note the different spelling of event_id
    }
)
```

## Aliases

Converge excels at matching events across browser sessions and your server-side data. This is all possible through aliases. Your customer is linked to multiple aliases, i.e. **multiple identifiers for the same customer**. Converge uses the customer's browser session cookie as the default alias.
When you add something as an alias, you are telling Converge that this alias is a unique identifier for this profile **across datasources**. In the examples below, we add `email` as an alias. Thus, Converge can merge a profile of browser events (e.g. Pageviews) with a profile with backend events (e.g. Started Subscription) if they have the same `email`.

In the examples below we add an `email` alias, other aliases that are useful:
- `cart_token`
- `checkout_token`: this is absolutely necessary if your checkout lives on a different domain than your storefront token.
- `customer_id`
