## Event Spec

This integration auto-tracks the following events on the server with all properties available according to the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec).

| Event Name                                          | Event Description                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order) | When a customer places an order. |

### Sales Channels

Events received by Converge from Bigcommerce are automatically mapped to Converge’s [sales channels types](/sources/concepts/sales-channels) whenever possible. 

More on sales channels can be found [here](/sources/concepts/sales-channels).

<Note> Converge fall back to "web" if a mapping cannot be found. This is typically the case with third party integrations with Bigcommerce. </Note>
