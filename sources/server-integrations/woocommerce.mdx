## Event Spec

This integration auto-tracks the following events on the server with all properties available according to the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec).

| Event Name                                          | Event Description                |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order) | When a customer places an order. |

### Sales Channels

Events received by Converge from a Woocommerce integration are automatically mapped to Convergeâ€™s [sales channels types](/sources/concepts/sales-channels) whenever possible. 

More on sales channels can be found [here](/sources/concepts/sales-channels).

<Note> Converge fall back to "web" if a mapping cannot be found. This is typically the case with third party integrations with Woocommerce. </Note>

An example of how Converge map Woocommerce sales channels:

| Woocommerce  | Converge              | Description                                                                        |
| ------------ | --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| checkout     | web                   | Browser                                                                            |
| subscription | subscription_contract | Subscription events                                                                |
| admin        | offline               | Manual orders                                                                      |
| rest-api     | -                     | Depends on third party integration, defaults to "web" if no valid mapping is found |


#### Third party integrations

For third-party integrations, Converge provides support for a metadata field that can be used to specify the sales channel type directly. 
This is particularly useful for custom implementations or when working with external systems that use the WooCommerce API to create or update orders.

Converge reads the metadata field called `sales_channel_type` to determine the appropriate sales channel type for the event. This metadata can be set in WooCommerce orders to override the default channel mapping. 
If this field is present and has a valid sales channel type value, Converge uses it to categorize the sales channel.
