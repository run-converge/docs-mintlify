Converge supports deduplication natively. You can deduplicate events with an optional `eventID` parameter. This is especially important for events that are used as conversions.
Converge will deduplicate events with the same `eventID` at ingestion time.

```javascript Converge Pixel - Javascript
cvg({
  method: "forward",
  eventName: "Placed Order",
  properties: {}, // your event properties
  eventID: "X01",
});
```

```python Converge Webhook - Python
resp = requests.post(
    "{YOUR_POSTBACK_ENDPOINT}",
    json=
        {
        "event_name": "Placed Order",
        "properties": {},
        "profile_properties": {},
        "event_id" : "XO1", # Note the different spelling of event_id
    }
)
```

### Limitations of deduplication

Converge only supports deduplication within a single datasource, for now. 
If you track the same event across multiple datasources, these will not be deduplicated.
