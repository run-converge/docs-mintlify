## An introductory example

Imagine an ecommerce store that has the following minimal customer journey:

1. **PageView**: User visits the storefront
2. **Added To Cart**: User adds an item to cart
3. **Placed Order**: User places an order

For the optimal setup, they will want to track `PageView` and `Added To Cart` on the browser, but `Placed Order` events on <Tooltip tip="Important to track 100% of conversions"> the server</Tooltip>.

### Challenges with server-side tracking 
There are three main challenges this store will need to deal with, all of which are important concepts in Converge.
-  <OutboundLink linkText="Profile properties" linkTarget="/sources/concepts/profile-properties"/>: to include browser-side information into the server-side order-event.
- <OutboundLink linkText="Deduplication" linkTarget="/sources/concepts/deduplication"/>: to make sure that the same order does not get processed twice.
- <OutboundLink linkText="Aliases" linkTarget="/sources/concepts/aliases"/>: to recognize which browser-side events and which server-side events come from the same user.
