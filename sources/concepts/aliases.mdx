## Introduction to aliases

### Server-side tracking and stitching problems

One of the main challenges with server-side tracking comes from being able to **stitch server-side conversions to their corresponding browser sessions**.

If server-side conversions cannot be linked to a browser sessions then that leads to downstream problems:
- **Conversions will not have browser-side information** (e.g. cookies, IP addresses) leading to lower ad performance and matching rates for [Connections](/connections/integrations/overview).
- **Conversions will not be able to be attributed**.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  id1("\`*Browser* \n Viewed Page\`") --> id2("\`*Browser* \n Started Checkout\`") -..- id3("\`*Server* \n Placed Order\`") ~~~ id4(["\`**Unstitched**  ⚠️ \`"])
  style id4 fill:#ffecec,stroke:none

```

Converge uses **aliases** to be able to solve for this problem.

### What are aliases?

Simply put, **an alias is a unique identifier for this profile across datasources**. 
To solve the stitching problem above, we could pass a `checkout_token` alias both on the browser-side **Started Checkout**-event, as well as on the server-side **Placed Order**-event allowing Converge to recognise that these events are part of the same profile and session.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  id1("\`*Browser* \n Viewed Page\`") --> id2("\`*Browser* \n Started Checkout \n **alias=checkout_token_xyz**\`") --> id3("\`*Server* \n Placed Order \n **alias=checkout_token_xyz**\`") ~~~ id4(["\`**Stitched**   ✓ \`"])
  style id4 fill:#ecffec,stroke:none

```

Aliases are typically used to stitch server-side conversions to website sessions, but you can also use aliases to merge profiles across multiple website domains, browsers or devices. 

Converge uses the customer's browser session cookie as the default alias in [Converge JS](/sources/website-integrations/converge-pixel.mdx). 
Furthermore, Converge has a set of default aliases for its default source integrations.

Some aliases that are typically useful to add:
- `cart_token`
- `checkout_token`: this is absolutely necessary if your checkout lives on a different domain than your storefront token.
- `customer_id`

        "aliases": ["urn:email:john.smith@apple.com"],
    }
)
```

```javascript Converge Pixel - Shopify Cart Token
cvg({
  method: "track",
  eventName: "Added To Cart",
  properties: {
    product_id: "123456",
    variant_id: "78910",
    sku: "MY_SKU",
    name: "My Product",
    variant_name: "Vanilla",
    price: 42,
    currency: "USD",
    quantity: 1,
    vendor: "My Store",
  },
  aliases: ["urn:shopify:cart_token:Z2NwLWV1cm9wZS13..."]
});

## Aliases for re-identification

### Default cookie behavior

Many browsers wipe all third-party cookies and all cookies that are set browser-side through JavaScript. 
For example, **Safari will wipe all of those cookies after 7 days**. 

This significantly impacts the accuracy of multitouch attribution.
Observe in the graph below how a customer who comes to your site in an interval longer than 8 days cannot be re-identified.


```mermaid
flowchart LR
  id1("\`*User* visits website with cookie **X**\`") -. 5 days later .-> id2("\`*User* visits website with cookie **X**\`") ~~~ id3(["\`**Re-identified**  ✓ \`"])
  style id3 color:#02b802,stroke:none


  id4("\`*User* visits website with cookie **X**\`") -. 8 days later (cookie is lost).-> id5("\`*User* visits website with cookie **Y**\`") ~~~ id6(["\`**Not re-identified** ✖ \`"])
  style id6 color:#d40027,stroke:none

```

For a full list of browsers and their cookie lifetimes, see <OutboundLink linkText="here" linkTarget="https://www.cookiestatus.com/#current-status" />


### Server-side first-party cookies

The reliable way to re-identify users over longer periods of time is through **server-side first-party cookies**. 
As illustrated in the graph below, these do reliably re-identify users.


```mermaid
flowchart LR
  id1("\`*User* visits website with server-side cookie **X**\`") -. up to 365 days later .-> id2("\`*User* visits website with server-side cookie **X**\`") ~~~ id3(["\`**Re-identified**  ✓ \`"])
  style id3 color:#02b802,stroke:none

```


### Leveraging server-side first-party cookies within Converge

By using a server-side first-party cookie as an **alias**, Converge can:
1. **Reliably re-identify your customers for multitouch attribution**. This is especially important for brands where the buying cycle is longer than the cookie lifetime of 7 days.
2. **Extend the lifetime of third-party cookies**: Converge stores third-party cookies that are relevant for your Connections in its <OutboundLink linkText="profile properties" linkTarget="/sources/concepts/profile-properties"/>. Converge can then retrieve these third-party cookies when it recognizes a customer after the 7-day period.

## Setting up a server-side first-party cookie

If you are using one of the Converge prebuilt integrations (e.g. for Shopify) then you are likely already using a server-side first-party cookie.
Check out your specific integration documentation to verify.

If you are integrating [Converge JS](/sources/website-integrations/converge-pixel) on your website, then you will need to implement this directly yourself.

### Installation Instructions

<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Set up a first-party server-side cookie" icon="server" >
    
    We provide a minimal code example below for Node.js, but any server web framework should be able to handle server-side cookies.

   <CodeGroup>
   
   ```js Node.JS Server
    // server.js

    const express = require('express');
    const cookieParser = require('cookie-parser');
    const uuid = require('uuid');

    const app = express();
    const PORT = 3000;

    app.use(cookieParser());

    // Middleware to generate and set unique visitor cookie if not already set
    app.use((req, res, next) => {
    if (!req.cookies.visitorId) {
        const visitorId = uuid.v4(); // Generate a unique visitor ID
        res.cookie('mystore_uid', visitorId, { maxAge: 365 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000, httpOnly: true });
    }
    next();
    });

    // Route to serve Next.js application
    app.use('/', require('./frontend'));

    app.listen(PORT, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
   ```
   </CodeGroup>
 

   </Accordion > 

   <Accordion title="Pass the cookie as an alias in all of your client-side ConvergeJS calls" icon="cookie" >
    
    Modify the code where you set up the `page_load` to include the cookie you set up above as an `alias`.
    We provide an example for Next.js, but this should be straightforwardly implemented in any framework.
    
    ```js NextJS
    import { useEffect } from "react";
    import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

    const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps, router }) => {
    useEffect(() => {
        const visitorId = Cookies.get('mystore_uid');
        const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
        cvg({method: "track", eventName: "$page_load", aliases: [`urn:mystore_uid:${visitorId}`]})
        };
        router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
        return () => {
        router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
        };
    }, []);
    return <Component {...pageProps} />;
    };
    export default MyApp;
    ```

   </Accordion >
   </AccordionGroup>
