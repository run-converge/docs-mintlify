title: "The Converge Event Spec"
---

#### Why the Converge Spec?

Most CDPs are not very strict about _which_ events you track, _where_ you track them (client or server) and with _which properties_.
This usually leads to problems with destinations downstream as each destination does have very specific integration requirements to operate optimally.

#### Advantages of a strict spec

Converge, therefore works with a strict Converge Event Spec.
Because we have a semantic understanding of what you are tracking, we can:

1. Automagically map your source events to destinations in the optimal way through our [Connections]().
2. Surface you meaningful analytics through our [Attribution]() product.
3. Monitor and flag when you are wrongly tracking events or properties negatively affecting your destinations or analytics through [Source Monitoring]().

Of course you can still extend the Converge Spec with your own events, properties, etc.

## Basic Events

These events and properties will always be auto-tracked by the [Converge Pixel]().

## Ecommerce Events

These events and properties should be passed for Ecommerce brands.
