      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`

        4. Download the WooCommerce Plugin by clicking on the following link: <DownloadLink linkTarget="https://static.runconverge.com/converge_woocommerce.zip" linkText="Download Plugin"/>
          
        5. In the WordPress admin dashboard, navigate to **Plugins** in the sidebar and click on **Upload Plugin**.

        8. In the Converge web app, click on the source you created in Step 1 and copy the **Public Token**. 
          <Info> The code consists of 6 characters and can be retrieved from the HTML snippet. If your script `src` looks like `https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/AYU51m.js`, then your public token is `AYU51m`. </Info>
        9. Navigate to **Tools** > **Converge** in the WooCommerce dashboard.
        10. Fill in the **Public Token** and save the configuration.
    </Step>
     <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        11. Check that the plugin is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`, `Added To Cart`, `Started Checkout` events by visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.
