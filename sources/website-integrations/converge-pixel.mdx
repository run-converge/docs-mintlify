## Event Spec

This integration auto-tracks the following events with all properties available according to the [Converge Event Spec](../converge-spec).

| Event Name                       | Event Description                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| [$page_load](../converge-spec#page-load) | When a customer views a page. |

--- 

## Installation Instructions

1. Log in to the [Converge webapp](app.runconverge.com) and click on the **Sources** tab in the left side-bar.
2. Click on **Create a new source** and pick _Client-side_ from the modal
3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
4. After creating the pixel, click on your pixel and from the modal pick _HTML_, it should look something like this.
  
   <Accordion icon="code" title="Code example"> 
   ```html
   <script
     src="<https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/{YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN}.js>"
     async
   ></script>
   <script>
     window.cvg||(c=window.cvg=function(){c.process?c.process.apply(c,argum
     ents):c.queue.push(arguments)},c.queue=[]);
     cvg({method:"track",eventName:"$page_load"});
   </script>
   ```
   </Accordion>
5. Copy the HTML snippet and include it in the header of your website.
6. Check that your pixel is working correctly by checking the `Source Log` and seeing events come in.


### Note for Single-page applications

<Warning>If you are using a single-page application, you should hook the `$page_load` tracking call above into your router to re-fire the event. </Warning>

<Accordion icon="code" title="Single-page code example"> 

```javascript NextJS
import { useEffect } from "react";
const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps, router }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      cvg({ method: "track", eventName: "$page_load" });
    };
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    return () => {
      router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, []);
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
};
export default MyApp;
```

## Cross-domain tracking

Converge supports cross-domain tracking out-of-the box. To enable cross-domain tracking from `myfirstdomain.com` to `myotherdomain.com`, include the following method together with the basic Converge pixel snippet.

<Info> Note that you do **not** need this snippet for tracking across subdomains.
i.e. if the pixel snippet is installed on `myfirstdomain.com` and on `checkout.myfirstdomain.com`, the sessions should be stitched across both domains automatically. </Info> 

```js
cvg({ method: "link_domain", domain: "myotherdomain.com" });
```

<Warning> If the redirect to `myotherdomain.com` does not happen directly through a link click, but for example through JS code, the parameter won't be added. So it is important to always test whether the `__cvg_uid` parameter is present on the new URL. </Warning>

## Manually instrument events

If the pre-built website integrations does not cover the entire [Converge Event Spec](../converge-spec); or if you want to add custom events from your website then you will need to manually instrument these using the Converge Pixel.
You can use the `track` method in the Converge Pixel for this purpose. 

<Note> As a general rule, you should always **aim to pass as many `properties`, `profileProperties` and `aliases` as possible** </Note>

The track method has the following parameters: 

- `eventName`: The name of the event
- `properties`: The event properties you want to pass, covering the Converge Spec and possible your own custom properties.
- `profileProperties`: The [profile properties](../source-concepts#profile-properties)
- `aliases`: Any [aliases](../source-concepts#aliases)
