## Installation Instructions

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new Client Source in Converge">
      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Converge HTML snippet in your storefront">
        4. Click on your newly created Source and from the modal pick `HTML`, and copy that snippet.
        <Accordion icon="code" title="Code example"> 
   ```html
   <script
     src="<https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/{YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN}.js>"
     async
   ></script>
   <script>
     window.cvg||(c=window.cvg=function(){c.process?c.process.apply(c,arguments):c.queue.push(arguments)},c.queue=[]);
     cvg({method:"track",eventName:"$page_load"});
   </script>
   ```
   </Accordion>
        5. Copy the HTML snippet and include it in the header of your website, right above the closing `</head>` tag.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        6. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `$page_load` events by visiting the website and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.
    </Step>
</Steps>


### Note for Single-page applications

<Warning>If you are using a single-page application, you should hook the `$page_load` tracking call into your router to re-fire the event. </Warning>


```javascript NextJS
import { useEffect } from "react";
const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps, router }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      cvg({ method: "track", eventName: "$page_load" });
    };
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    return () => {
      router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, []);
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
};
export default MyApp;
```

## Cross-domain tracking

Converge supports cross-domain tracking through the methods below. We can stitch sessions across different domains and make sure that cookie information, UTM attribution, etc. will work correctly.

Note that you do **not** need to do anything for tracking across subdomains.
i.e. if the pixel snippet is installed on `myfirstdomain.com` and on `checkout.myfirstdomain.com`, the sessions should be stitched across both domains automatically.

If you want to stitch a session from `myfirstdomain.com` to `myotherdomain.com` then you will want to make sure to implement it as per the instructions below.


### How does cross-domain tracking work

Converge allows for cross-domain tracking through the `__cvg_uid` parameter and cookie. 
If Converge recognizes the same `__cvg_uid` identifier for pageviews on `myfirstdomain.com` and pageviews on `myotherdomain.com` then it will stitch those sessions under the same profile and session.

To stitch, we need to be able to pass the cookie between different websites as the cookie is only generated if the `__cvg_uid` is not set in the URL.
If there is a `__cvg_uid` set in the URL as a parameter, the cookie will be set to this value.


```mermaid
flowchart LR
  id1("\`*User* visits **myfirstdomain.com** and gets assigned **__cvg_uid=1234**\`") -. "Clicks on link myotherdomain.com/?__cvg_uid=1234" .-> id2("\`*User* visits **myotherdomain.com** and the Converge reads the id from the URL\`") ~~~ id3(["\`**Session stitched**  âœ“ \`"])
  style id3 color:#02b802,stroke:none

```

### The `link_domain`-method

The Converge Pixel exposes the `link_domain`-method to automatically add the `?__cvg_uid={CVG_ID_VALUE}` suffix to every outbound link that leads to `myotherdomain.com`.
Include the following method together with the basic Converge pixel snippet on the `myfirstdomain.com` website to enable it on every page.

```js
cvg({ method: "link_domain", domain: "myotherdomain.com" });
```

<Warning> 

If the redirect to `myotherdomain.com` does not happen directly through a link click, but for example, through JS code, the parameter won't be added. So it is important to always test whether the `__cvg_uid` parameter is present on the new URL. 

You will need to manually instrument the link by adding the `?__cvg_uid` URL parameter and its corresponding cookie value for each outbound link in that case.
</Warning>

## Manually instrumenting events

If the pre-built website integrations do not cover the entire [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec); or if you want to add custom events from your website then you will need to manually instrument these using the Converge Pixel.
You can use the `track` method in the Converge Pixel for this purpose. 

<Note> As a general rule, you should always **aim to pass as many `properties`, `profileProperties` and `aliases` as possible** </Note>

The track method has the following parameters: 

- `eventName`: The name of the event
- `properties`: The event properties you want to pass, covering the Converge Spec and possibly your own custom properties.
- `profileProperties`: The [profile properties](/sources/source-concepts#profile-properties)
- `aliases`: Any [aliases](/sources/source-concepts#aliases)
