<AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Installing the Converge JS Pixel" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" >

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new Client Source in Converge">
      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Converge HMTL snippet in your storefront">
        4. Click on your created newly created Source and from the modal pick `HTML`, copy that snippet.
        <Accordion icon="code" title="Code example"> 
   ```html
   <script
     src="<https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/{YOUR_PUBLIC_TOKEN}.js>"
     async
   ></script>
   <script>
     window.cvg||(c=window.cvg=function(){c.process?c.process.apply(c,argum
     ents):c.queue.push(arguments)},c.queue=[]);
     cvg({method:"track",eventName:"$page_load"});
   </script>
   ```
   </Accordion>
        5. Copy the HTML snippet and include it in the header of your website, right above the closing `</head>` tag.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        6. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`-events through visiting the website and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.
    </Step>
</Steps>
   </Accordion >
   </AccordionGroup>

### Note for Single-page applications

<Warning>If you are using a single-page application, you should hook the `$page_load` tracking call above into your router to re-fire the event. </Warning>

<Accordion icon="code" title="Single-page code example"> 

```javascript NextJS
import { useEffect } from "react";
const MyApp = ({ Component, pageProps, router }) => {
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      cvg({ method: "track", eventName: "$page_load" });
    };
    router.events.on("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    return () => {
      router.events.off("routeChangeComplete", handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, []);
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
};
export default MyApp;
```

</Accordion>

## Cross-domain tracking

Converge supports cross-domain tracking out-of-the box. To enable cross-domain tracking from `myfirstdomain.com` to `myotherdomain.com`, include the following method together with the basic Converge pixel snippet.

<Info> Note that you do **not** need this snippet for tracking across subdomains.
i.e. if the pixel snippet is installed on `myfirstdomain.com` and on `checkout.myfirstdomain.com`, the sessions should be stitched across both domains automatically. </Info> 

```js
cvg({ method: "link_domain", domain: "myotherdomain.com" });
```

<Warning> If the redirect to `myotherdomain.com` does not happen directly through a link click, but for example through JS code, the parameter won't be added. So it is important to always test whether the `__cvg_uid` parameter is present on the new URL. </Warning>

## Manually instrumenting events

If the pre-built website integrations does not cover the entire [Converge Event Spec](../converge-spec); or if you want to add custom events from your website then you will need to manually instrument these using the Converge Pixel.
You can use the `track` method in the Converge Pixel for this purpose. 

<Note> As a general rule, you should always **aim to pass as many `properties`, `profileProperties` and `aliases` as possible** </Note>

The track method has the following parameters: 

- `eventName`: The name of the event
- `properties`: The event properties you want to pass, covering the Converge Spec and possible your own custom properties.
- `profileProperties`: The [profile properties](../source-concepts#profile-properties)
- `aliases`: Any [aliases](../source-concepts#aliases)
