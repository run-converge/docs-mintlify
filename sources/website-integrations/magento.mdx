  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new Client Source in Converge">
      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Magento Plugin">
        4. Add the Converge repository to your Magento 2 project's `composer.json` file:

            ```bash bash
            composer config repositories.repo-name vcs https://github.com/run-converge/converge-magento2
            ```
        5. Run the following command to install the Converge Magento 2 module:
            ```bash bash
            composer require run-converge/converge-magento2:0.1.4
            ```
        6. Enable the Converge module using the Magento CLI:
            ```bash bash
            bin/magento module:enable Converge_Converge
            ```
        7. Upgrade your Magento setup to ensure the Converge module is integrated properly:
           ```bash bash
           bin/magento setup:upgrade
           ```
        8. Deploy static content to your Magento store for the Converge module:
           ```bash bash
           bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy
           ```
    </Step>
    <Step title="Configure the Converge Magento Plugin with your public token">
        9. In the Converge Webapp, click on the source you created in Step 1 and copy the **Public Token**. The code consists of 6 characters and can be retrieved from the HTML snippet. If your script `src` looks like `https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/AYU51m.js`, then your public token is `AYU51m`.
        10. Go to `Stores` > `Settings` > `Configuration` > `Converge` > `Converge` and add your public token you just retrieved.  
    </Step>
     <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
       11. Check that the plugin is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`, `Added To Cart`, and `Started Checkout` events by visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.
