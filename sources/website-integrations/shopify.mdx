    <Accordion title="Installing the Shopify Storefront Integration" icon="store" >

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new Client Source in Converge">
      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Converge Liquid snippet in your storefront">

    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        8. Always double-check that you did not break anything on the site after inserting the snippet. 
        <Info>   It's good practice to **add the snippet to other themes in development as well** and to add this snippet to your version control, so a theme switch does not kill website tracking </Info>
        9. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`, `Viewed Product` and `Viewed Collection` events through visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.

      <Accordion title="Tracking supplementary events and properties using Converge JS" icon="code" >

        <Steps>
    <Step title="Track the remaining Converge Spec">
The Converge JS pixel only picks up [$page_load](/sources/converge-spec#page-load)-events by default for a headless store.
        You will typically have to supplement the following events using Converge JS for all Connections to work optimally.
        - [Viewed Product](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-product)
        - [Viewed Collection](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-collection)
        - [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)

        For more information on manually instrumenting events, read [here](/sources/website-integrations/converge-pixel#manually-instrumenting-events). 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add appropriate aliases to stitch the session across all sources ">
        At this point, you should be tracking the entire Converge Ecommerce Spec. 
        However, for a Headless setup, it is paramount that you set the `checkout_token` as an alias **before** redirecting the user to the Shopify Checkout to make sure that the storefront session and the checkout session can be linked to the same user.
        You can read more about aliases [here](/sources/source-concepts#aliases).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        Check that your setup is working by doing an entire user journey from `$page_load` to `Placed Order` and verifying that all events are properly tracked without any [Source Warnings]().

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I need both a Shopify Liquid and a Shopify Checkout Pixel?">
  When you install the Shopify Web integration, you will install both the Shopify Storefront integration (which lives in the `theme.liquid`) a snippet in the Shopify Liquid as well as a Checkout integration, which leverages Shopify App Pixels.
  You can check which integration checks which events in the [Integration Event Spec](#event-spec).

  The difference between the Liquid Pixel and the Checkout Pixel is that the Checkout Pixel is completely sandboxed by Shopify and loads with a large delay, see more info [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/overview) on the limitations of App Pixels.
  This is undesirable for events such as `$page_load`, where a user may browse away before the Converge pixel is loaded and before this event can be tracked.

  For that reason, you would want to track all events in the `theme.liquid`. However, **Shopify does not allow you to track reliably on the Checkout using this approach**.
