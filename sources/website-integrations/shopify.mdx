## Installation Instruction

The Converge Shopify Pixel consists of installing the (i) storefront pixel and the (ii) checkout pixel.
Both are necessary to capture the entire [Event Spec](#event-spec).

### Storefront Integration

1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
4. Copy the _Shopify Liquid_ snippet
5. In the Shopify dashboard, navigate to **Sales Channels** > **Online Store** > **Themes**
6. Click on "**...**" next to the _Customize_ button, and click **Edit code**.
7. Go to the _theme.liquid_ file and insert the snippet right above the closing `</head>` tag in the theme.liquid file. Click **Save**
8. Always doublecheck that you did not break anything on the site after inserting the snippet It's good practice to **add the snippet to other themes in development as well**, so a theme switch does not kill website tracking
9. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some page_load events through visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in Converge.
