The Shopify Website Integration consists of two integrations covering the full tracking spec.
1. The Shopify Storefront Integration
2. The Shopify Checkout Integration

## Installation Instructions

The installation process of Converge is slightly different based on whether you have a **Shopify Liquid** storefront; or whether you are running a **Shopify Headless** Storefront.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Shopify Liquid">

  The Converge Website installation for a Shopify Liquid store consists of:

  
  <AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Installing the Shopify Storefront Integration" icon="store" >

  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new Client Source in Converge">
      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Converge Liquid snippet in your storefront">
        4. Click on your newly created Source and from the modal pick `Shopify Liquid`, and copy that snippet.
        5. In the Shopify admin dashboard, navigate to **Sales Channels** > **Online Store** > **Themes**
        6. Click on "**...**" next to the _Customize_ button, and click **Edit code**.
        7. Go to the _theme.liquid_ file and insert the snippet right above the closing `</head>` tag in the theme.liquid file. Click **Save**
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        8. Always double-check that you did not break anything on the site after inserting the snippet. 
        <Info>   It's good practice to **add the snippet to other themes in development as well** and to add this snippet to your version control, so a theme switch does not kill website tracking </Info>
        9. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`, `Viewed Product` and `Viewed Collection` events by visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.
    </Step>

        9. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `Added To Cart`, `Started Checkout` and `Added Payment Info` events by visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.

            <Note> 
            If you do not see `Added To Cart`, `Started Checkout` and `Added Payment Info` events coming in, verify in your Custom Pixel settings whether you have set the **Permission** flag to **Not required**.

    <Step title="Track the remaining Converge Spec">
The Converge JS pixel only picks up [$page_load](/sources/converge-spec#page-load)-events by default for a headless store.
        You will typically have to supplement the following events using Converge JS for all Connections to work optimally.
        - [Viewed Product](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-product)
        - [Viewed Collection](/sources/converge-spec#viewed-collection)
        - [Added To Cart](/sources/converge-spec#added-to-cart)

        For more information on manually instrumenting events, read [here](/sources/website-integrations/converge-pixel#manually-instrumenting-events). 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add appropriate aliases to stitch the session across all sources">
        At this point, you should be tracking the entire Converge Ecommerce Spec. 
        However, for a Headless setup, it is paramount that you set the `checkout_token` as an alias **before** redirecting the user to the Shopify Checkout to make sure that the storefront session and the checkout session can be linked to the same user.
        You can read more about aliases [here](/sources/source-concepts#aliases).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        Check that your setup is working by doing an entire user journey from `$page_load` to `Placed Order` and verifying that all events are properly tracked without any [Source Warnings]().

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Why do I need both a Shopify Liquid and a Shopify Checkout Pixel?">
  When you install the Shopify Web integration, you will install both the Shopify Storefront integration (which lives in the `theme.liquid`) a snippet in the Shopify Liquid as well as a Checkout integration, which leverages Shopify App Pixels.
  You can check which integration checks which events in the [Integration Event Spec](#event-spec).

  The difference between the Liquid Pixel and the Checkout Pixel is that the Checkout Pixel is completely sandboxed by Shopify and loads with a large delay, see more info [here](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/promoting-marketing/pixels/overview) on the limitations of App Pixels.
  This is undesirable for events such as `$page_load`, where a user may browse away before the Converge pixel is loaded and before this event can be tracked.

  For that reason, you would want to track all events in the `theme.liquid`. However, **Shopify does not allow you to track reliably on the Checkout using this approach**.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Why do I have too little Checkout and Add To Cart events?">
  You might have Privacy settings set up in Shopify that limit us from tracking the Checkout. 
  1. Navigate to the Shopify Admin dashboard, navigate to **Settings** > **Customer Events** and find the `Converge Pixel`.
  2. Click on it to open the settings. 
  3. Verify in your Custom Pixel settings whether you have set the **Permission** flag to **Not required**.

## Event Spec

This integration auto-tracks the following events on the browser with all properties available according to the [Converge Event Spec](/sources/converge-spec).

| Event Name                                                                  | Event Description                                        | Integration |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |

| [Subscribed To Newsletter](/sources/converge-spec#subscribed-to-newsletter) | When a customer subscribes to your newsletter.           | Checkout    |
| [Placed Order](/sources/converge-spec#placed-order)                         | When a customer places an order.                         | Checkout    |


This integration also auto-tracks some additional events that are not part of the Converge Event Spec.

| Event Name          | Event Description                                                | Integration |

| Added Shipping Info | When a customer fills in their shipping info in the checkout     | Checkout    |

## Utility Object

<Note> Note that this utility object is not available on the Shopify Checkout. </Note>

Converge exposes a utility object called `__cvg_shopify_info` that picks up useful event properties and profile properties automatically. 

We give an example below of requesting this object and what it looks like in the code example below.

<Accordion icon="code" title="Example of the utility object on a Product Page">
