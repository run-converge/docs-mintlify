      1. In Converge, click on **Create a new source**
        2. Pick _Client-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your pixel: e.g. `{Storename} Storefront`
    </Step>
    <Step title="Install the Converge Liquid snippet in your storefront">

    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        8. Always doublecheck that you did not break anything on the site after inserting the snippet. 
        <Info>   It's good practice to **add the snippet to other themes in development as well** and to add this snippet to your version control, so a theme switch does not kill website tracking </Info>
        9. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`, `Viewed Product` and `Viewed Collection` events through visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.

      <Accordion title="Tracking supplementary events and properties using Converge JS" icon="code" >

        <Steps>
    <Step title="Track the remaining Converge Spec">
The Converge JS pixel only picks up [$page_load](../converge-spec#page-load)-events by default for a headless store.
        You will typically have to supplement the following events using Converge JS for all Connections to work optimally.
        - [Viewed Product](../converge-spec#viewed-product)
        - [Viewed Collection](../converge-spec#viewed-collection)
        - [Added To Cart](../converge-spec#added-to-cart)

        For more information on manually instrumenting events, read [here](./converge-pixel#manually-instrument-events). 
    </Step>
    <Step title="Add approppriate aliases to stitch the session across all sources ">
        At this point, you should be tracking the entire Converge Ecommerce Spec. 
        However, for a Headless setup, it is paramount that you set the `checkout_token` as an alias **before** redirecting the user to the Shopify Checkout to make sure that the storefront session and the checkout session can be linked to the same user.
        You can read more about aliases [here](../source-concepts/aliases).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        Check that your setup is working by doing an entire user journey from `$page_load` to `Placed Order` and verifying that all events are properly tracked without any [Source Warnings]().
