    </Step>
    <Step title="Verify that the integration is working correctly">
        8. Always doublecheck that you did not break anything on the site after inserting the snippet. 
        <Info>   It's good practice to **add the snippet to other themes in development as well** and to add this snippet to your version control, so a theme switch does not kill website tracking </Info>
        9. Check that your pixel is working correctly by generating some `$page_load`, `Viewed Product` and `Viewed Collection` events through visiting the store and seeing that these events arrive in the Source Log.
