## Installation Instructions

The Converge Website installation for a Funnelish storefront consists of:

  
  <AccordionGroup>

    <Accordion title="Install the Funnelish Webhook Connection" icon="server" >

    The Funnelish webhook connection allows Converge to stitch the Funnelish orders to the browser sessions.


  <Steps>
    <Step title="Create a new Webhook Source in Converge">
        1. In Converge, navigate to **Sources** and click on <IconText name="circle-plus" text="Create New Source" iconLocation="before" iconType="regular"/ >
        2. Pick _Server-side_ from the modal
        3. Name your source: e.g. `{Storename} Funnelish Storefront` and pick the **Funnelish**-app from the dropdown.
            <Frame>
            ![funnelish-2](/images/sources/funnelish/funnelish-2.png)
            </Frame>
        4. If you already have a Shopify Source and Funnelish syncs all of the orders to Shopify, then you should **not** turn on the _Track Funnelish orders as Placed Order conversions_. If you will be using Funnelish as your order backend instead, then you should turn on the switch.
        5. Click on **Create Source**.
        6. Copy the link that is displayed under _Postback Endpoint_, you will need it later.
            <Frame>

    </Step>
</Steps>
   </Accordion >
   <Warning> Make sure the Facebook App in Funnelish is turned off completely, as you will suffer from duplicate tracking if this is not the case. Make sure the Facebook app is turned off both on a general level, **and** on a per-funnel basis. </Warning>
<Accordion title="Install the Converge Pixel on your Funnelish Funnel" icon="browser">
    <Note> You need to do this for **every new and existing funnel you set up**. </Note>

    4. Now you will want to copy paste the script below.

       

        <Accordion title="Click to see tracking script" icon="code"> 
            ```html
        <script
            src="https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/YOUR-TRACKING-TOKEN.js"
            async
        ></script>
        <script>
            window.cvg ||
            ((c = window.cvg =
                function () {
                c.process ? c.process.apply(c, arguments) : c.queue.push(arguments);
                }),
            (c.queue = []));
            cvg({ method: "track", eventName: "$page_load" });
        </script>

        <script>
            let ViewContentURLIdentifier = "YOUR-VIEWCONTENT-IDENTIFIER";
            let AddToCartURLIdentifier = "YOUR-ADDTOCART-IDENTIFIER";
            let InitiateCheckoutURLIdentifier = "YOUR-CHECKOUT-IDENTIFIER";

            if (window.location.href.includes(AddToCartURLIdentifier)) {
            cvg({
                method: "track",
                eventName: "Added To Cart",
                properties: {
                product_id: "1",
                variant_id: "1",
                name: "Product Name",
                variant_name: "Variant Name",
                price: 0,
                currency: "EUR",
                quantity: 1,
                },
            });
            }

            if (window.location.href.includes(ViewContentURLIdentifier)) {
            cvg({
                method: "track",
                eventName: "Added To Cart",
                properties: {
                product_id: "1",
                variant_id: "1",
                name: "Product Name",
                variant_name: "Variant Name",
                price: 0,
                currency: "EUR",
                },
            });
            }

            // InitiateCheckout and Added To Cart can be on same URL
            if (window.location.href.includes(InitiateCheckoutURLIdentifier)) {
            cvg({ method: "track", eventName: "Started Checkout" });
            }
        </script>
        ```

        </Accordion>
         <Note> You will need to do a few modifications described in step 5-7 to the script. </Note>

        

        5. Navigate to your Converge dashboard and find the pixel you are using for Funnelish. Click on the pixel and copy the tracking token as per the screenshot below.
        <Frame>
        ![funnelish-14](/images/sources/funnelish/funnelish-14.png)
        </Frame>

        6. Replace the `YOUR-TRACKING-TOKEN` field in the script pasted with your personal Converge token.
        <Frame>
        ![funnelish-15](/images/sources/funnelish/funnelish-15.png)
        </Frame>

        7. Replace the `YOUR-ADDTOCART-IDENTIFIER` and `YOUR-CHECKOUT-IDENTIFIER` values with values that uniquely identify a URL in the funnel where you want to trigger this event.
        
            <Info> As an example, if you want to trigger an AddToCart event on the `myfunnelishstore.com/cart` page, then you will want to replace `YOUR-ADDTOCART-IDENTIFIER` with `cart`. **These identifiers might be different values for different funnels**, so doublecheck when implementing a new funnel.</Info>


        8. Click on **Create code** and on **Save changes**.
