description: "Set up first-party tracking by passing Converge requests through your own domain"

## Overview

By proxying requests to Converge through your own domain, Converge is no longer treated as a third-party script.
This has the following advantages:
- **First-party cookies** When Converge runs on your main domain, we automatically set a first-party cookie.
First-party cookies are not restricted by browser privacy features like ITP. They are longer-lasting, allowing you to track longer user journeys.
- **Bypassing ad blockers** Converge's domain is not yet blocked by ad blockers, but this future-proofs your implementation. Ensure that all browser data arrives at Converge.

## Installation Instructions

There are two parts to proxying requests to Converge:
- **Hosting the script on your own domain** By proxying requests to `https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/*.js` the Converge script is loaded through your domain.
- **Proxying the tracking requests** By proxying requests to `https://app.runconverge.com/api/tr/*` the tracking requests are sent through your domain.

<Note>
Ensure that the proxy sets the `X-Forwarded-For` header to the original IP address of the request.
</Note>

To let Converge know your proxied domain, update your Converge pixel snippet as follows:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Update the `src` of the Converge script to point to your domain. Replace `xxxxxx` with your Converge pixel public token.
        ```html
        <script src="https://yourdomain.com/cvg/static/pixels/xxxxxx.js" async></script>
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Include the `set_endpoint` call to configure your proxied endpoint.
        ```javascript
        cvg({method: 'set_endpoint', endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.com/cvg'})
        ```
        This should happen before any tracking calls.
    </Step>
</Steps>

This would yield the following updated snippet:
```html
<script src="https://yourdomain.com/cvg/static/pixels/xxxxxx.js" async></script>
<script>
window.cvg||(cvg=function(){cvg.process?cvg.process.apply(cvg,arguments):cvg.queue.push(arguments)},cvg.queue=[]);
cvg({method: 'set_endpoint', endpoint: 'https://yourdomain.com/cvg'})
cvg({method:"track",eventName:"$page_load"});
</script>
```

### Setting up a proxy through Vercel rewrites

If your site is hosted on Vercel, you can use the vercel.json configuration file to easily set up a proxy to Converge.
Replace `xxxxxx` with your Converge pixel public token.

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/cvg/xxxxxx.js",
      "destination": "https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/xxxxxx.js"
    },
    {
      "source": "/cvg/:method",
      "has": [
        { "type": "query", "key": "public_token", "value": "xxxxxx" }
      ],
      "destination": "https://app.runconverge.com/api/tr/:method"
    }
  ]
}
```

Update your Converge pixel snippet to the following:

```html
<script src="/cvg/xxxxxx.js" async></script>
<script>
window.cvg||(cvg=function(){cvg.process?cvg.process.apply(cvg,arguments):cvg.queue.push(arguments)},cvg.queue=[]);
cvg({method: 'set_endpoint', endpoint: '/cvg'})
cvg({method:"track",eventName:"$page_load"});
</script>
```

After deploying the changes, verify that
- the `xxxxxx.js` script loads from your own domain
- tracking requests to `/tr/*` are proxied through your domain
- the response headers from the `/tr/track` call include the `Set-Cookie` header which sets a `__cvg_1p_uid` cookie
