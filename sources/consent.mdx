## Overview

You can configure how the Converge connections should behave based on the visitor's consent preferences.
To set this up, you need to send the consent to Converge.

You still need a CMP, cookie banner provider, or your own solution to collect the preference.

While this allows you to configure how connections handle consent,
regardless of the configured consent, events will still be sent to Converge.

## The consent method

The `cvg` object has a `consent` method that you can use to send the visitor's consent preferences to Converge.
It takes two arguments, we recommend always sending both.
- `analytics`:
    Preference for analytics tracking. Possible values are `granted`, and `denied`.
    If not set, Converge will assume that the visitor has `denied` consent.
- `marketing`:
    Preference for marketing tracking. Possible values are `granted`, and `denied`.
    If not set, Converge will assume that the visitor has `denied` consent.

See the examples below.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="chart-simple" title="The visitor has granted consent for only analytics tracking">
    ```javascript
    cvg({ 
        "method": "consent",
        "analytics": "granted",
    })
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="chart-simple" title="Equivalent to granting consent for only analytics tracking">
    ```javascript
    cvg({
        "method": "consent",
        "analytics": "granted",
        "marketing": "denied",
    })
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="envelopes-bulk" title="The visitor has granted consent for both analytics and marketing tracking">
    ```javascript
    cvg({
        "method": "consent",
        "analytics": "granted",
        "marketing": "granted",
    })
    ```
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion icon="radiation" title="The visitor has denied consent for both analytics and marketing tracking">
    ```javascript
    cvg({
        "method": "consent",
        "analytics": "denied",
        "marketing": "denied",
    })
    ```
    </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
You need to make sure the `cvg` object is available before you call the `consent` method.
If this is not the case, include the following snippet before calling `cvg`.
```javascript
window.cvg||(cvg=function(){cvg.process?cvg.process.apply(cvg,arguments):cvg.queue.push(arguments)},cvg.queue=[]);
```
</Note>


## Storing consent

Consent should be sent every time the user visits the page.
Typically, you will rely on your CMP or own cookie banner implementation to retrieve the visitor's consent and send it to Converge.

Converge stores the consent preferences in the visitor's browser as a backup.
But, to make sure that it is up-to-date, you should still specify it every time the converge snippet loads.

The preferences are also stored on the Converge **profile**, under the `profile_properties`.
This is used to filter events when forwarding server-side.

<Accordion title="Inspect the consent parameters for a profile">
The consent preferences are stored in the **profile properties**, under the `$consent` key. This object is used to filter the server-side events.
```json profile_properties
{
    ...
    "$consent": {
        "analytics": "granted",
        "marketing": "denied"
    }
}
```
</Accordion>

## Sending consent

When Converge has not received any consent preferences, we will default to `denied` consent.
For that reason, we recommend calling the consent method before the Converge snippet.

```html Configuring consent before the tracking
<script src="https://static.runconverge.com/pixels/xxxxxx.js" async></script>
<script>
    window.cvg||(cvg=function(){cvg.process?cvg.process.apply(cvg,arguments):cvg.queue.push(arguments)},cvg.queue=[]);
    cvg({ 
        "method": "consent",
        "analytics": "granted",
        "marketing": "granted",
    })
    cvg({method:"track", eventName:"$page_load"});
</script>

```

## Default consent

The Converge consent can be updated while the visitor is browsing the page.
To set a default consent, you can simply call the `consent` method with the static default preferences -- and later on, update them as follows.

```javascript Default to granted consent until the visitor denies marketing
cvg({ 
    "method": "consent",
    "analytics": "granted",
    "marketing": "granted",
})

// When the visitor denies marketing
function denyMarketing() {
    cvg({ 
        "method": "consent",
        "analytics": "granted",
        "marketing": "denied",
    })
}
```
