At Converge we are building Customer Data Infrastructure for Commerce (and B2C more broadly).

Converge is good at a few things:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Fast Installation" icon="bolt">
    Deep integrations with all major shopping platforms. Allowing you to track
    your full funnel in less than 15 minutes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Server-side Conversions" icon="server">
    Track 100% of conversions by sending them from your server. Converge takes
    care of linking these to the right profile and website session.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Destinations with Batteries Included" icon="battery-full">
    Whether it's *Enhanced Conversions*, *Facebook CAPI* or *Server-side GTM*,
    Converge natively supports the optimal tracking setup per destination.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Customer re-identification" icon="id-badge">
    It may take many sessions for a customer to convert. Converge's identity
    graph makes sure that all sessions leading up to a conversion get tracked.
