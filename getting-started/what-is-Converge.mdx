### The all-in-one data platform for paid customer acquisition

Converge allows you to set up optimal customer data infrastructure for B2C and Ecommerce. 
  - Built for **server-side tracking**, meaning 100% of conversions get tracked 
  - Batteries included **identity resolution** at ingestation
  - Includes **first-party attribution out-of-the-box**


### Why is separate data infrastructure for marketing teams needed?
 
**Optimal marketing measurement** is *hard* as it **requires expertise in both: (i) data engineering and (ii) marketing**

To get a simple marketing report such as CPA numbers by channel, engineers have to set up and integrate a myriad of tools:
A CDP to capture customer events, ETL to sync ad platform data into a Data Warehouse, dbt to join both types of data together and a BI tool on top of the data warehouse.

Each integration is a vector for problems to occur, leading to a distrust of marketing teams in their reporting.


### Converge as an integrated alternative for marketing measurement

Converge, **manages everything end-to-end** from event collection all the way until the BI layer. 

Thus, we allow: 
1. Marketers to trust that their marketing reporting, attribution and ad targeting is optimal 
2. Engineers to be abstracted away from all marketing best practices

### Our two core products

**Connections**: We track conversions on the servers instead of the browser, which allows us to mitigate any traditional hurdles like vpns, ad blockers, etc. 
This makes sure that your (FB / Google) Ads Manager reporting is trustworthy and leads to optimal ad performance

**Reporting Suite**: Converge allows you to bring together and freely query the three most important metrics for paid marketing: 
- Blended Reporting
- In-Platform Reporting
- UTM-based / First-party attribution reporting
