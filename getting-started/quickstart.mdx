## Getting Started with Converge 

Welcome to the Converge guide. Follow the instructions below to learn how to get your data into Converge and set up your first connection.

### 1. Get your Customer Data in Converge

To get started with Converge, you need to track the [Converge Event Spec](../sources/converge-spec).
Converge has pre-built integrations with most Shopping Platforms, simply pick your platform below and follow the steps.

<Note> Most Converge installations only involve a Storefront and Store Backend setup. If you leverage custom checkouts, subscriptions or landing page builders, you will want to connect these as well. </Note>
