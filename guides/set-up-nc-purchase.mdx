### Why you should care about New Customer Events in your Meta Ads Manager

Even when you set up exclusions correctly, Meta usually does quite a lot of re-targeting on existing customers. 

Most performance marketers want to focus their Meta spend (almost) exclusively on acquiring **new** customers.

Sending a `NewCustomerPurchase` event to Meta that excludes all existing customer conversions, allows you to:
- **Report in-platform on CAC**: Brands often want to get a sense of how much they are paying for a new customer (CAC) and not (only) how much they are paying for a purchase.
- **Optimize towards New Customers**: You can force the Meta ad targeting algorithm to only be rewarded for New Customer conversions when using this as an optimization event.


### Step-by-step installation instructions

1. Go to your Meta Events Manager and click on **Custom Conversions** > **Create custom conversion**.

   <Note>
   If you do not see the `NewCustomerPurchase` event, go to the Meta Events Manager overview and verify this `NewCustomerPurchase` event before continuing.
   </Note>

3. In the **Choose a standard event for optimization**-field, choose `Purchase`.

14. Done ðŸŽ‰
    &nbsp;

    <Note> Initially, it will seem like no New Customer Purchase data is showing up in the Ads Manager because Meta does not support attributing custom conversions from the past. </Note>
