## What is UTM-based attribution

UTM-based conversions are conversions based on UTM-tracking parameters that you add to links to your website. As an example, you might tag the link to your website from one of your Meta ads with a `utm_source=facebook` UTM hyperparameter. 

This hyperparameter makes sure that when a tracking pixel such as Converge on your website starts tracking a user in a session, it knows that this session came from Meta. 

Because users can have multiple sessions before they purchase, the same purchase can be attributed to different channels based on the [attribution model](/attribution/channels#changing-the-attribution-model-of-your-utm-conversions) that you pick.
In the flowchart below, based on a **first-touch**-model, the purchase should be attributed to Meta. Based on a **last-touch** model, the purchase should be attributed to Google.

## What is in-platform attribution

In-platform conversions are conversions as calculated by the attribution model of the ad platform itself. 
As an example, when you mark in Meta a _"7-day click, 1-day view"_ model and look at the Facebook Ads Manager, you see all conversions that Facebook believes that came from a click on the ad in the last 7 days or a view of the ad in the last day.

This is typically the model that the ad platform will use itself to optimize its ad targeting.

## Which attribution method should I choose to make decisions?

You should typically include both numbers in your decision-making, as they both have their own strengths and weaknesses.
You can find a summary of both methods below.

| Attribution Model | Strengths |  Weaknesses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **UTM-based method** | **Great for relative comparisons**: UTM metrics allow you to compare all channels based on the same attribution model  | **May be less accurate**: UTM-based attribution methods cannot take into account view-through conversions or cannot stitch sessions across devices |
| **In-platform based method** | **Better accuracy**: in-platform metrics are usually more accurate because ad platforms have more data to attribute (they know which users viewed ads). | **Hard to compare across traffic sources**: Every ad platform employs different attribution models, making it infeasible to compare conversions. Some channels (e.g Organic) do not have in-platform attribution.

As a general rule of thumb, a UTM-based methods is better for relative comparisons **across traffic sources** and in-platform based metrics are better to check performance **within a traffic source** (e.g comparing the number of different Meta campaigns against each other).


## Known limitations of UTM-based attribution in relative comparisons 

Although the UTM-based attribution method is better for relative comparisons, it comes with some known limitations.

**UTM-based attribution typically underreports top-of-funnel channels** (e.g. Meta and TikTok)
Because UTM-based tracking does not work across device and does not have any information on view-through conversions, it tends to get worse at reporting things top-of-funnel (in sessions early in the customer funnel).
The longer an average customer takes to convert the more underreported these channels will be.

**UTM-based attribution typically overreports conversions to search and brand traffic** 
Because UTM-based tracking might miss earlier sessions until conversion, it will tend to overreport channels that are later in the customer journey such as brand or search traffic.
