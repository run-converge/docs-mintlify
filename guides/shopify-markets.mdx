Converge supports any internationalization setup you may have on your Shopify store.
Whether you have multiple stores, or a single store serving multiple markets. Whether you have the same analytics and marketing setup for all countries, or different setups for each country.
You can set up the exact tracking and marketing setup to scale across borders.

To navigate the guide below, you need to understand the following:
- Do you want to break out the Converge data by market, or aggregate your revenue, spend, CPA, etc. across all markets?
- Do you have multiple Shopify stores for different markets, or a single Shopify store serving multiple markets?
- Do you have different ad accounts, analytics properties, etc. for each market?

## Workspaces
Within Converge, you can decide to set everything up within a **single workspace**, or create separate workspaces for each market.
Separate workspaces allow you to keep the revenue, spend, CPA, etc. data separate. In a single workspace, all data is aggregated accross your markets.

<Note>
To set up new workspaces for new markets, please contact Converge support.
</Note>

## Shopify installation

<Note>
If you are not treating your markets as separate entities, you can follow the regular Shopify setup guide [here](/sources/server-integrations/shopify).
</Note>

You need to create different **pixels** and **datasources** for each market.
If you decided on using a single workspace, you can create all of these within the same workspace.
Otherwise, create a new **pixel** and **datasource** within each workspace, corresponding to its market.

### Multiple shopify stores serving different markets

This is the most common setup and easiest to configure.
You have set up entirely different Shopify stores for different markets, for example `my-store-us.myshopify.com` and `my-store-uk.myshopify.com`.

You can follow the regular Shopify setup guide [here](/sources/server-integrations/shopify).
Repeat the installation for each store and create a new pixel and datasource each time.
If you added them to the same workspace, this can look like this:

### Single Shopify store serving multiple markets

<Warning>
    This is an intricate setup. Please consult with your development or data team before proceeding.
</Warning>

In this case, it's a bit harder to separate your stores.
You should still create separate pixels and datasources for each market, and decide whether to add these to the same workspace or different workspaces.
Follow the regular Shopify setup guide [here](/sources/server-integrations/shopify) for each market, for the same Shopify store, but take into account the following modifications.

#### Server integration

Converge separates your markets by the **shipping country**.
Each Shopify market has a different set of shipping countries.
When creating the server integration, tick the **Filter Shopify markets** option.
Select the markets for which you're setting up this source.

<Frame>
![shopify-markets-gb](/images/guides/shopify-markets-server.png)
</Frame>


<Note>
    Your source will **filter the orders based on the shipping countries that are part of the market when creating the source**.
    Please take care to update your setup accordingly when your markets configuration changes.
    Converge will display the following message in the sources configuration when it detects that the filtered countries are not up to date with the current Shopify markets configuration:

    <Frame>
        ![outdated](/images/guides/outdated.png)
    </Frame>
</Note>

<Warning>
    The `Received Refund` event will no longer be tracked when the source is configured with the **Filter Shopify markets** option.
</Warning>

#### Browser integration
Because you have a single Shopify store, you have only a storefront and theme. So you need to install multiple pixels in the same `theme.liquid` file.

You need to decide whether to split the pixels by domain, locale, or any other criteria.
Please advise with the team that built your website and set up the different markets. They can help you decide the best way to split the pixels.

In the example below, we separate the `.eu` domain for the `/de` and `/es` subfolders from the others.

## Connections setup

### Multiple workspaces    

If you have broken out your markets into separate workspaces, you can create connections as usual within each workspace.
In case a single ad account is served by multiple markets, you should recreate the connnection in each workspace.

### Single workspace

If you have a single workspace, you can create connections for each market within the same workspace.
If an ad account is served by a single market, you can use the [connection sources](/connections/filters#source-filters) to specify the markets for which data should be forwarded.

<Note>
    Select both the **server and browser** source you created for this market.
</Note>

See the below example to only send data for a UK store to the UK facebook pixel.
